Have you ever thought that that's a waste?   "Maximize the web browsing efficiency", it is the concept of "Sushi Browser".  "Multiple panels, sync scrolling, sidebar, swapping and aligning panels etc. are some of the gimmicks it has onboard. In addition to the above, its 20+ strong and convenient functions include "video support function, tab operation function,session manager, and downloader".  [Downloads](#downloads)![OverView](https://sushib.me/myimg/top.jpg)## Table of Contents* [Special features](#special-features)  * [Multi panel](#multi-panel)  * [Video Support Function](#video-support-function)  * [Tab](#tab)  * [Useful features](#useful-features)  * [Web Technologies](#web-technologies)* [Downloads](#downloads)* [New Features](#new-features)* [TODO](#todo)# Special features## Multi panel  The browser's greatest feature is the specialized display and operation using multiple panels.   It not only displays multiple web pages side-by-side but it also has various functions. Please check [here](https://sushib.me/tips/#multi-panel/) for more details.![multi-panel](https://sushib.me/myimg/multi-panel2.gif)#### 1. Split PanelThe panel can be divided by dragging the tab towards the corner of the panel.  It can also be divided from the right click menu on the tab as well.The divided panel is available for the size change as well.#### 2. Display to the opposite panel  By **middle clicking (pressing the mouse wheel)** the link you can open the page in the link to the opposite panel.   **Middle clicking** with 1 panel automatically splits the display into 2 panels.   Of course, just like ordinary browsers, it can be configured to open a new browser. #### 3. Sync scrolling By pressing the Sync scroll button, 1 page can be lined up like the pages of a book.  Moreover, for a group of panels at this state, you can do actions such as scroll, page transition or close at the same time. 　 Also, right clicking the we page, you can choose from a menu for a 2-page spread that reads left to right or from right to left. (Commonly it's left to right) #### 4. Side (bottom) barYou can open favorite pages or pages from your history using the side bar.  The side bar can display web pages same as common panels. 　　  The difference to common panels is even if you change the window size, the width remains fixed, and only this cannot be used with sync scrolling. #### 5. Other- Panel movement: this browser can be moved all the tabs of one panel to other panel or window by dragging or dropping the tab addition button.- Swapping panels: You can switch the position of 2 panels. - Aligning panels: Panels can be lined up with fixed widths horizontally or vertically. - Switch direction: You can realign vertically-lined panels horizontally or horizontally-lined panels vertically. - Simultaneous scrolling: By moving the mouse wheel, you can scroll 2 panels at the same time.## Video Support FunctionSushi Browser has support functions for such as video downloading and mouse operation,it can be used as a video playback browser.  *For video download, please do no not violate the terms of the Web service and use at your own risk.Please check [here](https://sushib.me/tips/#video/) for more details.![video](https://sushib.me/myimg/video.gif)#### 1.

Multi-row tabMulti-row tabs can be used in the Sushi Browser. And ordinary tabs can be switched to Multi-row tabs from the main menu.  #### 2. Vertical Tab, Tree TabVertical tabs can be used in Sushi Browser. Vertical tabs can be displayed from the sidebar icon of the menu bar.   It's also possible to hide ordinary tabs when displaying vertical tabs.  #### 3. Tab PreviewYou can use Tap Preview of Pop-up method and sliding method.(Same as Edge or Vivaldi)  #### 4. Other- Tab selection using the mousewheel： By moving the mousewheel over the tab bar, tabs can be selected by scrolling.    - Various Settings： Many settings referring to Mix Plus can be arranged from the setting page.## Useful features### 1. Session ManagerThis browser has a session control system that preserves the condition of the window of browser and tab at regular interval and plays.  There is also a function for the recover of tab like a tab trush and a tab record.  ### 2.
